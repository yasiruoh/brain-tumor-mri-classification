# Brain MRI Classification

ResNet50 CNN classification of four MRI image categories, with an optional CNN-feature SVM adapter.

## Application

- Streamlit interface with explicit input validation and error handling.
- Structured JSON results and configurable review threshold.
- Local processing; no input upload to an inference service.
- Docker configuration and GitHub Actions source checks.
- Separate inference module and dependency-light validation tests.

## Run

Python 3.11 is the target environment. From the extracted repository folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the local address printed by Streamlit. Dependency installation and first-use model retrieval require internet access. A GPU is not required by the application code; CPU inference can be resource intensive.

## Model backend

The selected pretrained checkpoint is retrieved automatically on first inference and cached by Hugging Face. Internet access and sufficient disk/memory are required for that first download. No local fitting step is required for the default backend.

Pretrained model development belongs to the credited upstream authors. This repository implements the application and integration; it does not claim original model fitting, published benchmark results, or clinical/security certification.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t brain-tumor-mri-classification .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 brain-tumor-mri-classification
```

Bind to localhost or add authenticated access before sharing a deployment. Model caches in a disposable container are not persistent unless a volume is configured.

## Validation

```bash
python -m compileall -q app.py src tests
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

See `VALIDATION.md` for the exact checks performed on this package. Source checks are not model-accuracy or full deployment validation. No measured accuracy is claimed for this integration.

## Scope and limitations

Research and educational use only. Not a medical device and not clinically validated. The default is a pretrained ResNet50 CNN. The optional SVM adapter is implemented but its fitted artifact is not bundled; it is not an available pretrained SVM result. No patient-level validation, DICOM support, segmentation, or clinical diagnosis is provided.
